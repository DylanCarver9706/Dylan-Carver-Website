      A little Bit About Me
    </u>
  </h1>
  <h2>
    My name is Dylan Carver, and I am from the St. Louis area in Missouri. I am 23 years old and live with my fianc√©,
    whom I have been dating for almost nine years. We met in 5th grade and have been dating since our freshman year of
    high school. We have been living together for a little over a year now, and just got a dog we named Bagel. Bagel is
    a pitbull/boxer mix and is about seven months old.

      Past
    </u>
  </h1>
  <h2>
    My journey started when I worked at Kmart in 2015 until it closed in 2017. I graduated from high school the same
    year. Shortly after, I started college at Jefferson College in Hillsboro, MO while working in the Walmart
    electronics department. When I graduated from Jefferson College in 2019 with my AAS in Business Management, I
    transferred to Missouri Baptist University Online. In 2021 I graduated with my BS in Business Administration. Since
    the pandemic, I have had a hard time finding a job with my lack of hard skills from my degree. Now I am starting my
    journey as a Software Engineer!

  <h2>
    I consistently play a videogame called Rocket League. My rank is champion 2, placing me in the top 10% of all
    players in the world. I also host a Dungeons & Dragons group at my house, and we stream every Monday on Twitch. We
    are called
    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/homies_n_homebrew">Homies & Homebrew</a>. Come check us out!

      Future Plans
    </u>
  </h1>
  <h2>
    My plans for the future are to get through the Flatiron Bootcamp while learning as much as possible. Then I would
    love a work-from-home position with a great company. Hopefully, by that time, the housing market will crash. Then my
    fiance and I can finally buy a house. I have always wanted to own and manage rental properties to generate passive
    income, so maybe in the near future, I'll be a software engineer in the morning, and a landlord in the evening.
