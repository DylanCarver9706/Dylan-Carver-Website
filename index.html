      Intro
    </h1>
    <h2>
      My name is Dylan and I am from the St. Louis area in Missouri. I am 23 years old and live with my fiance whom I have been dating for almost 7 years. We met in 5th grade and have been dating since our freshman year of high school. We have been living together for a little over a year now and just got a dog we named Bagel. Bagel is a pitbull/boxer mix and is about 7 months old.

      Past
    </h1>
    <h2>
      My journey started when I worked at Kmart in 2015 until it closed in 2019. This was also the same year I graduated from high school. I started at Jefferson College in Hillsboro, MO shortly after while working at Walmart in the electronics department. When I graduated from Jefferson College in 2019 with my AAS in Business Management, I transferred to Missouri Baptist University Online. In 2021 I graduated with my BS in Business Administration. Since the pandemic, I have had a hard time finding a job with my lack of hard skills. Now I am starting my journey as a Software Engineer!

      Future Plans
    </h1>
    <h2>
      My plans for the future are to get through the Flatiron Bootcamp while learning as much as possible. Then I would love a work-from-home position with a great company. Hopefully, by that time, the housing market will crash and my fiance and I can buy a house. I have always wanted to own and manage a rental property to generate passive income, so maybe in the near future, Iâ€™ll be a software engineer in the morning and a landlord in the evening.
