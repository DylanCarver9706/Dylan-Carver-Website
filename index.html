    <h2>
        My name is Dylan and I am from the St. Louis area in Missouri. 
        I am 21 years old and I live with my fiance whom I have been dating for almost 7 years. 
        We met in 5th grade and have been dating since our freshman year of high school. 
        We have been living together for a little over a year now and just got a dog we named Bagel.
        Bagel is a pitbull/boxer mix and is about 7 months old.
